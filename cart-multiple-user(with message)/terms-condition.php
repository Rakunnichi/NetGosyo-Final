                    any remaining provisions in such jurisdiction nor the validity and enforceability of the provision
                    in question under the law of any other jurisdiction.

                    NetGosyo) after such changes have been posted shall constitute your acceptance of such revised Terms
                    of Service.

                <p class="text-justify"><b>24.3.</b> You may not assign, sublicense or transfer any rights granted to

                    of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right at a later time to enforce the same
                    unless the same is waived in writing.
                </p>

                <p class="text-justify"><b>24.6.</b> These Terms of Service are solely for your and our benefit and are
